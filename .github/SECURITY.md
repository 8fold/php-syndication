# Security Policy

The only completely secure system is the one that doesn't exist in the first place. Having said that, we take security seriously.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please disclose potential security issues by email to [joshbruce](https://github.com/joshbruce). We will provide an initial assessment of security reports within 72 hours and should apply patches within 2 weeks (also, feel free to contribute a fix for the issue).
