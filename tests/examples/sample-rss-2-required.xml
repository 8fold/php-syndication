It feels like it's winding down. Later in the week I'm going to a &lt;a href="http://harvardbusinessonline.hbsp.harvard.edu/b02/en/conferences/conf_detail.jhtml?id=s775stg&amp;pid=144XCF"&gt;conference&lt;/a&gt; put on by the Harvard Business School. So that should change the topic a bit. The following week I'm off to Colorado for the &lt;a href="http://www.digitalidworld.com/conference/2002/index.php"&gt;Digital ID World&lt;/a&gt; conference. We had to go through namespaces, and it turns out that weblogs are a great way to work around mail lists that are clogged with &lt;a href="http://www.userland.com/whatIsStopEnergy"&gt;stop energy&lt;/a&gt;. I think we solved the problem, have reached a consensus, and will be ready to move forward shortly.</description></item><item><title>Law and Order</title></item></channel></rss>
