It feels like it's winding down. Later in the week I'm going to a <a href="http://harvardbusinessonline.hbsp.harvard.edu/b02/en/conferences/conf_detail.jhtml?id=s775stg&pid=144XCF">conference</a> put on by the Harvard Business School. So that should change the topic a bit. The following week I'm off to Colorado for the <a href="http://www.digitalidworld.com/conference/2002/index.php">Digital ID World</a> conference. We had to go through namespaces, and it turns out that weblogs are a great way to work around mail lists that are clogged with <a href="http://www.userland.com/whatIsStopEnergy">stop energy</a>. I think we solved the problem, have reached a consensus, and will be ready to move forward shortly.</description><pubDate>Mon, 30 Sep 2002 01:56:02 GMT</pubDate><guid>http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2002/09/29#When:6:56:02PM</guid></item><item><title>Law and Order</title><link>http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2002/09/29#lawAndOrder</link></item></channel></rss>
